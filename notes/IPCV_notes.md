#  Image Processing

>The aim of image processing is to transorm a given image into a new clearer (or easier) one to analyze.  

+ ***Example***: we have an iamge with grainy noise (maybe due to lighting issues) and we want de-noise it.
+ ***Example***: reduce motion blur effect when taking a picture of fast moving object.
+ ***Example***: remove blur from a blurred image (maybe out of focus).

>Create a Crisp and clear image. Highlight informations difficult to see at first.

## Topics

1. Pixel processing
    + simpliest computer vision technique
    + go to each pixel and look a brightness and color value
    + use a predeterming mapping to trasforma each pixel
2. LSIS and Convolution
