# Learining python and OpenCV

## First step

Python borns as a programming language that aim to be clear to read. If we take a look a comparison between c and pyhton we can understand why.

``` c
include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // this is a comment
    printf("Hello!"\n);
    return 0;
}
```

``` python
# this is a comment
print("Hello!")
```

>As we can see we are explicitly typing only what we want and nothing more.
